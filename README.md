# Fridge Tool

(Temporary name 😥) (Temporary Readme) (Temporary everithing 😭)

## Purpose

Real life story 😓: Tired of watching my food die in the fridge, and unable to think for myself what to do with it, I decided to nip this problem in the bud.

Solution 🤯: A tool that generates recipes with what I have in the fridge.

Instead of thinking about the meal and then getting frustrated because I don't have the Italian tomatoes with the cilantro harvested on the side of a volcano, this tool makes life painless, so I don't have to think and get frustrated, I just tell it what I already have and it generates possible recipes.
